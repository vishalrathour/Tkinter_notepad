Creating Notepad Using Tkinter Python Librarie
<b>This Python code creates a basic text editor using the Tkinter library. The editor offers functions like creating, opening, and saving text files, along with standard text editing operations such as cut, copy, and paste. The "Help" menu includes a simple "About Notepad" option. The editor's window resizes automatically, and the title updates to reflect the currently edited file. It serves as a minimalistic starting point for building more advanced text editors, with potential for customization and expansion. Users can run the script, interact with the graphical interface, and perform these text-related tasks in a user-friendly manner.</b>
